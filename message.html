            did indeed made a website
            for your birthday so we can host our collaborated playlist and

        <p>SALAM KING RAJ AL QAEDER THE MAJESTY OF THE POOPY LANDS !!!!!!!!!
            I blessedth thee with plentiful fortune and zingy tunes on the
            summer solstice which circumvents the solar eclipse and
            manifests on the high tide of your birthing. I chant my sacred
            jargon derived from my nifty tongue and wish upon the the seven
            stars of the quantum universe in the eleven dimension of
            relativity to grant thee a most exultant and buoyant of
            birthdays. I clasp my metacarpus in prayer for the highly
            anticipated arrival of thee latvian prince so your pinheaded
            bitching will cease.</p>

        <p>Dear Nosrat, Happy (late) 20th Birthday! I hope that you can hang
            out with us more this year
            and finally escape your parents clutches so that we can go
            FINALLY go to Melbourne and eat
            at the One Piece cafe!!! And while you're at it, pls try and
            attend the sleepover I'm planning,
            like c'mon bro we are gonna be MORE THAN TWENTY years old and
            not even ONE sleepover yet!? That's
            so sad, we are being deprived of the achieving the American
            Dream ™️ (Girls Night).
            Anyways, hope you enjoy the gifts this year!! (and don't forget
            to personally
            thank hayley for the sick website omg)
        </p>
